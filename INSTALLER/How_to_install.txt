In order to utilize the scripts created with Python-language the computer has to be able to understand
the language itself. This is why Python compiler has to be installed on the computer running the scripts.

Upon installing Python many default libraries will automatically be installed as well.
However, Excel-coding requires additional libraries like "xlrd" and "openpyxl" to work. These libraries
aren't automatically installed with the others alongside Python. This is what the installer is for.

Follow these steps to install the script environment.


1.  Install the newest version of Python (v3.10 or newer) from Microsoft Store.

2.  Extract the contents of a release.zip file.

3.  Run the installer "Script_Installer.py" on Windows PowerShell using python
    to install the required libraries used by the scripts.
