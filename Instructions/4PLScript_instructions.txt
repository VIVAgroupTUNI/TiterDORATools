Instructions on how to use 4PLScript.py python script.
Additionally, these instructions contain the information about DORA test data provided.


-  Analyzes data generated by the DORAScripts. 

-  Extracts data from selected groups, validates data and performs four parameter logistic (4PL) regression function to fit the data. 

-  Creates new sheets into the data file to store the data (IC50/CC50/EC50 value, LogIC50/CC50/EC50 value, and HillSlope). 

-  Additionally, creates graphs for selected groups and stores them as .png files into result_files directory.



Prerequirements

-  Data file in data_files directory. 

-  Data file contains a sheet with collected logarithmic dilution values (Log Dil) and normalized response values for each defined sample in defined groups.

-  Excel file must be closed during script run or script will give error message.


Parameter conditions

-  Analysis type can be either IC50, CC50, or EC50.


Script run

1.  Open Windows PowerShell by going into Source directory, typing "powershell" to address bar and pressing Enter.

2.  Run script by typing "python 4PLScript.py" on Windows PowerShell. To access more instructions on how the script functions, run the script with any of the following parameters ["i", "info", "h", "help"] e.g., "python 4PLScript.py help" on Windows PowerShell.

3.  After script run, the results are shown in the provided raw data file and generated graphs in result_files directory.

4.  To continue data analysis, move to STATScript instructions.



Instructions on how provided test data was run with DORAScripts. Continuation from DORAScript instructions.

Example 1: Test_DORA_384wp.xlsx

Script run:

4PL curve fiting:
	- Open Windows PowerShell as instructed above.
	- Run script by typing "python 4PLScript.py"
	- Select data file: Test_DORA_384wp.xlsx
	- Select data sheet: SCR_group_EXPORT
	- Select groups for analysis: SELECT ALL
	- Select analysis type: IC50

To continue data analysis, run STATScript.py and follow STATScript instructions.
