Instructions on how to use DORAScript_96.py and DORAScript_384.py python scripts.
These instructions also contain information about example DORA test data provided.


Introduction:

-  Analyze data from dose response analyses (DORA) such as inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50), effective concentration 50% (EC50) and cytotoxic concentration 50% (CC50) assays. 

-  Extract and arrange data based on user inputs, calculate descriptives (averages and standard deviations) and normalize the measured data between 0% and 100% average values calculated from the control wells.


Prerequirements:

-  Configuration file and data file are available in config_files and data_files directories, respectively. 

-  Excel only contains one well plate of data per file when using DORAScript_96.py (see EXTRACTScript_instructions.txt). 

-  All data in the data file must be scripted/excluded or else the script will give an error message.

-  Excel file must be closed during script run or script will give error message.


Parameter conditions:

-  Analysis type can be either IC50, CC50, EC50 or EXCLUDE_DATA. Using EXCLUDE_DATA option, the selected data will not appear into results after script run.
-  Group label can be letters, numbers, or combination of them. 
-  Initial dilution can be positive decimal or integer number.
-  Dilution factor can be positive or negative decimal or integer number.
-  Sample count can be maximum of 8 in 96wp format and 32 in 384 wp format. Sample count depends on the parallel count.
-  Parallel count can be 1, 2, 4 or 8.
-  Sample label can be letters, numbers, or combination of them.


Basic script run:

1.  Close all Excel files that are analysed/used by the scripts (i.e. data files).

2.  Open Windows PowerShell by going into Source directory, typing "powershell" into address bar and pressing Enter.

3.  Run script by typing "python DORAScript_96.py" or "python DORAScript_384.py" on Windows PowerShell. To access more instructions on how the script functions, run the script with any of the following parameters ["i", "info", "h", "help"] e.g., "python DORAScript_384.py help" on Windows PowerShell.

4.  

3.  After script run, the results are shown in the provided raw data file.

4.  To continue data analysis, move to 4PLScript instructions.

	- Select data sheet: Test DORA
	- Select analysis type: IC50
	- Write group label: 1
	- Write initial dilution: 16
	- Write dilution factor: 2
	- Write number of sample: 1
	- Write number of parallels: 4
	- Write label for sample 1: sample 1
	- Write yes/no for adding new group: yes
	- Select analysis type: IC50
	- Write group label: 1
	- Write initial dilution: 16
	- Write dilution factor: 2
	- Write number of sample: 1
	- Write number of parallels: 4
	- Write label for sample 1: sample 2
