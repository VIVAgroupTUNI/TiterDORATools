Instructions on how to use EPDScript_96.py and EPDScript_384.py python scripts.
Additionally, these instructions contain the information about EPD test data provided.



-  EPDScript_96.py and EPDScript_384.py analyze data from endpoint dilution (EPD) assay such as TCID50 assay. 

-  Scripts extract and arrange data based on user inputs, score wells for cytopathic effects and calculate descriptives (averages and standard deviations for controls) and TCID50/ml based on improved Kärbers formula.


Prerequirements

-  Configuration file, data file and master file are available in config_files, data_files and master_files directories, respectively.

-  Excel file containing raw data should only contain one well plate of data per file when using EPDScript_96.py (see EXTRACTScript.py instructions).

-  Master file needs to contain at least "tube label" and "tissue" information before running the scripts.

-  All data in the data file must be scripted or else the script will give an error message.


Parameter conditions:

-  15 different tissue options to choose from.
-  Dilution rate can be positive decimal or integer number.
-  First dilution can be positive decimal or integer number.
-  Working volume can be positive decimal or integer number and should be presented as milliliters (ml).
-  Sample count can be maximum of 2 in 96wp format and 8 in 384 wp format. Sample count depends on the parallel count.
-  Parallel count can be 4 or 8.
-  Tube label can be letters, numbers, or combination of them.


Script run

1.  Open Windows PowerShell by going into Source directory, typing "powershell" to address bar and pressing Enter.

2.  Run script by typing "python EPDScript_96.py" or "python EPDScript_384.py" on Windows PowerShell. To access more instructions on how the script functions, run the script with any of the following parameters ["i", "info", "h", "help"] e.g., "python EPDScript_384.py help" on Windows PowerShell.

3.  After script run, the results are shown in the provided raw data file and in the master file.
