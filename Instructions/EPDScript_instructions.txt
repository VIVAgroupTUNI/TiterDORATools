Instructions on how to use EPDScript_96.py and EPDScript_384.py python scripts.
These instructions also contain information about example EPD test data provided.


Introduction:

-  EPDScript_96.py and EPDScript_384.py analyze data from endpoint dilution (EPD) assay such as TCID50 assay. 

-  Scripts extract and arrange data based on user inputs, score wells for cytopathic effects and 
   calculate descriptives    (averages and standard deviations for controls) and TCID50/ml based 
   on improved Kärber's formula.


Prerequirements:

-  Configuration file, data file and master file are available in config_files, data_files and 
   master_files directories, respectively.

-  Excel file containing raw data should only contain one well plate of data per file when using 
   EPDScript_96.py (see EXTRACTScript_instructions.txt).

-  Master file needs to contain at least "tube label" and "tissue" information before running the scripts.

-  All data in the data file must be scripted or else the script will give an error message.

-  Excel file must be closed during script run or script will give an error message.


Parameter conditions:

-  15 different tissue options to choose from.
-  Dilution rate can be positive decimal or integer number.
-  First dilution can be positive decimal or integer number.
-  Working volume can be positive decimal or integer number and should be presented as milliliters (ml).
-  Sample count can be maximum of 2 in 96wp format and 8 in 384 wp format. 
   Sample count depends on the parallel count.
-  Parallel count can be 4 or 8.
-  Tube label can be letters, numbers, or combination of them.


Basic script run:

1.  Add necessary parameters to master file (at least "tube label" and "tissue") before running the script.

2.  Close Excel files that are analysed/used by the script (i.e. master file and data files).

3.  Open Windows PowerShell by going into Source directory in TiterDORATools-main.zip,
    typing "powershell" into address bar and pressing Enter.

4.  Run script by typing "python EPDScript_96.py" or "python EPDScript_384.py" on Windows PowerShell. 
    To access more instructions on how the script functions, run the script with any of the following 
    parameters ["i", "info", "h", "help"] e.g., "python EPDScript_384.py help" on Windows PowerShell.

5.  Follow script prompts and choose/fill correct parameters. Do this by either selecting correct option 
    by typing correct number for the prompt or by writing correct value/text and then pressing Enter to move forward.

6.  After script run, the results are shown in the raw data file in new sheets and in the master file.
