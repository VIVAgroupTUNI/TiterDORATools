Instructions on how to use STATScript.py python script.
These instructions also contain information about example DORA test data provided.


Introduction:

-  Runs non-parametric statistical tests for selected groups either Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's test for pairwise comparisons or Mann-Whitney U test. 

-  P-values are corrected with Bonferroni correction. 

-  Creates a new sheet into the data file to store results. 

-  Shows results in table format with p-values and statistical significance indicated by symbols that correspond to "not significant", "0.05", "0.01", "0.001" and "0.0001" level of significance.


Prerequirements:

-  Data file available in data_files directory. 

-  Data file contains a sheet generated by 4PLScript.py or excel sheet formated the same way. Sheet contains the IC50/CC50/EC50 results.

-  Excel file must be closed during script run or script will give error message.



Basic script run:

1.  Close Excel files that are analysed/used by the script (i.e. data files).

2.  Open Windows PowerShell by going into Source directory, typing "powershell" to address bar and pressing Enter.

3.  Run script by typing "python STATScript.py" on Windows PowerShell. To access more instructions on how the script functions, run the script with any of the following parameters ["i", "info", "h", "help"] e.g., "python STATScript.py help" on Windows PowerShell.

4.  Follow script prompts and choose/fill correct parameters. Do this by either selecting correct option by typing number and pressing Enter or by writing correct value/text and then pressing Enter to move forward.

5.  After script run, the results are shown in the raw data file in new sheet.



Instructions on how the test data was run with DORAScripts. Continuation from 4PLScript instructions.

Example 1: Test_DORA_384wp.xlsx

Script run:

Statistical analysis:
	- Open Windows PowerShell as instructed above.
	- Run script by typing "python STATScript.py"
	- Select data file: Test_DORA_384wp.xlsx
	- Select data sheet: SCR_ic50_RESULTS
	- Select statistical test: Mann-Whitney
