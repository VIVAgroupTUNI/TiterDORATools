# TiterDORATools

Supplementary code for paper Quantitative enterovirus infectivity titration and dose response analysis using cell-culture based methods and python code assisted data analysis.

We provide a collection of Python scripts to analyse data and perform statistcal analyses to data from endpoint dilution (EPD: TCID50) assay or dose response analyses (DORA). 

The full script package containing the files and directories to run all the scripts is in Script Package directory. It includes the scripts for the two different analyses (EPD and DORA), different well-plate formats (96- and 384-well plates), and different analysis steps for the DORA data (normalization, 4PL fitting and statistical analysis).

Instruction directory contains short, basic instruction for installing Python and required libraries using Script_Installer.py, and how to use the use the scripts.

To access tutorial for more detailed instructions on what the scripts do and what should be considered for each script, run the script with any of the following parameters ["i", "info", "h", "help"] e.g., "python EPDScript_384.py help" on Windows PowerShell.

## System requirements and packages

Python code has been implemented and tested with Python 3.11.9. The scripts use the following Python packages:
- numpy 1.26.4
- openpyxl 3.1.5
- matplotlib 3.9.1
- scipy 1.14.0
- xlrd 2.0.1
- pandas 2.2.2
- scikit_posthocs 0.11.4

## Script Package

The Script Package conains the scripts and necessary directories and files to run the scripts.

### Directories

The package needs to contain the following directories: config_files, data_files, master_files, and results_files. 
- Config_files contains configuration files used by the EPD scripts (EPDScript_96.py and EPDScript_384.py), DORA scripts (DORAScript_96.py and DORAScript_384.py) and 4PLScript.py. 
- Data_files should contain the raw data files that will be analysed by the scripts. 
- Master_file should contain the master file where EPD results are stored. Example master file is provided, see further instructions from tutorial as explained above. 
- Result_files will contain the graphs and files generated by 4PLScript.py and EXTRACTScript.py.
